If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to Banana, please email us about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

LucidWorks is the commercial entity behind the long-standing and popular Open Source Project Apache Lucene/Solr. We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code.

Collaboration space (issues, wiki, etc.) for Banana will be setup soon.
